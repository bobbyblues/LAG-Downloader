# Script to download episodes from Les autres gens (www.lesautresgens.com)
# How to use:
# - Go to the webpage of the episode you want (for example http://www.lesautresgens.com/spip.php?article50)
# - Save the webpage source code (as test.html for example)
# - Run 'python getEpisode.py test.html'
# This will download all the pages from the episode and store them in a cbz archive
# Of course you need an account on lesautresgens.com to have access to the full episodes
#
# Moreover, when you visit an episode webpage, temporary urls are created for the different images
# So you need to run this script relatively soon after you generate the html code
